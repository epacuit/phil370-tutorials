In this tutorial, we introduce the notation and terminology that will be used this semester to reason about sets. There are two ways to denote a set: List all the items in the set. The items should be separated by a comma and the list shouuld be written between curly brackets: ' \\(\\}\\) ' and ' \\(\\{\\) '. For example, \\(\\{a,b,c,e\\}\\) is the set consisting of the first 5 letters of the alphabet, and \\(\\{1, 3, 5\\}\\) is the set consisting of the first 3 odd numbers. Define a property that all items in the set have in common. This is useful when listing all the elements of the set is too cumbersome or impossible. For example, the set of all positive integers is \\(\\{x\\ |\\ x \\text{ is an integer} \\text{ and } x\\geq 0 \\}\\) . This is read \"the set of all \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is an integer and \\(x\\) is greater than or equal to zero\". Note In these notes, sets are denoted with uppercase letters. However, there is no standard notation for sets. For instance, some texts may use lowercase letters to denote sets. There are two ways that we can talk about the items that are contained in a set. Element Suppose that \\(A\\) is a set. We write \\(x\\in A\\) when \\(x\\) is an element of \\(A\\) and \\(x\\not\\in A\\) when \\(x\\) is not an element of \\(A\\) . Subset Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both sets. We say \\(A\\) is a subset of a set \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\subseteq B\\) , provided that for all \\(x\\) , if \\(x\\in A\\) , then \\(x\\in B\\) . We write \\(A\\not\\subseteq B\\) when \\(A\\) is not a subset of \\(B\\) , and \\(A\\subsetneq B\\) when \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(B\\) : \\(A\\subseteq B\\) and there is some \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\in B\\) and \\(x\\not\\in A\\) . Example \\(0\\in \\{0, 1, 3\\}\\) \\(2\\not\\in \\{0, 1, 3\\}\\) \\(\\{0, 1, 3\\}\\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) \\(\\{0, 1, 3\\}\\not\\subseteq \\{0, 2, 4\\}\\) \\(\\{0, 1, 3\\}\\subseteq \\{0, 1, 3\\}\\) \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\subsetneq \\{0, 1, 3\\}\\) It will be useful to introduce notation for a set containing no elements. Emptyset The set that contains no elements is called the emptyset , or null set . We write \\(\\varnothing\\) to denote the emptyset. A key fact about the empty set is that it is a subset of any set: for all sets \\(X\\) , \\(\\varnothing\\subseteq X\\) . The reason why \\(\\varnothing \\subseteq X\\) for any set \\(X\\) is that since \\(\\varnothing\\) does not contain any elements, so there is no element that is contained in \\(\\varnothing\\) but not in \\(X\\) . Note that it is possible for a set to contain other sets as elements. For instance, the set \\(X=\\{a, b, c\\}\\) has three elements: \\(a\\in X\\) , \\(b\\in X\\) and \\(c\\in X\\) , but \\(Y=\\{a, \\{b, c\\}\\}\\) has two elements: \\(a\\in Y\\) and \\(\\{b,c\\}\\in Y\\) . Can a set contain an element that is also a subset? Yes. Let \\(Z=\\{a, \\{a\\}\\}\\) . Then, \\(\\{a\\}\\in Z\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\subseteq Z\\) (since \\(a\\in Z\\) ). So, \\(\\{a\\}\\) is both an element of \\(Z\\) and a subset of \\(Z\\) . Caution We use the phrase \"...is contained in\" when talking about both elements and subsets. If \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) , then it is common to say that \" \\(A\\) contains \\(1\\) \" or \" \\(1\\) is contained in \\(A\\) \". Something that can be confusing for beginners is that it is also common to say that \"the set \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) is contained in \\(A\\) \". Given a set \\(A\\) , the powerset of \\(A\\) is the set containing all the subsets of \\(A\\) : Powerset Suppose that \\(A\\) is a set. The powerset of \\(A\\) is the set \\(\\wp(A)=\\{B\\ |\\ B\\subseteq A\\}.\\) Note that for any set \\(A\\) , \\(\\varnothing\\in\\wp(A)\\) . Example Suppose that \\(A=\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) . The powerset of \\(A\\) is: \\[ \\wp(A)=\\{\\varnothing, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3\\}\\}. \\] Operations on Sets There are two basic operations that combine a set \\(A\\) and a set \\(B\\) to form another set: The union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\cup B\\) , is the set of all elements in either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) . The intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\cap B\\) , is the set of all elements in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) . Union Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two sets. The union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\cup B\\) , is the set \\(A\\cup B=\\{x\\ |\\ x\\in A\\text{ or } x\\in B\\}.\\) More generally, if \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is any collection of sets, then \\[ \\bigcup \\mathcal{S} = \\{x\\ |\\ x\\in A \\mbox{ for some } A\\in\\mathcal{S}\\}. \\] Intersection Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two sets. The intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\cap B\\) , is the set \\(A\\cap B=\\{x\\ |\\ x\\in A\\text{ and } x\\in B\\}.\\) More generally, if \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is any collection of sets, then \\[ \\bigcap \\mathcal{S} = \\{x\\ |\\ x\\in A \\text{ for all $A\\in\\mathcal{S}$}\\}. \\] Example of union and intersection If \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{a,b\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cup B=\\{1,2,3,a,b\\}\\) . If \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1,3,4\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cup B=\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) . If \\(A=\\{1,2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{\\{1,3\\}, 4\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cup B=\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\{1,3\\}, 4\\}\\) . If \\(A=\\{1,2\\}\\) , \\(B=\\{2,3\\}\\) and \\(C=\\{1,2, 4\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cup (B\\cup C) = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) If \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cap B=\\{1\\}\\) . If \\(A=\\{1,2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{\\{1,3\\}, 2\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cap B=\\{ 2\\}\\) . If \\(A=\\{1, 2\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{3, 4\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cap B=\\varnothing\\) (i.e., there are no elements in \\(A\\cap B\\) ). If \\(A=\\{1,2\\}\\) , \\(B=\\{2,3\\}\\) and \\(C=\\{1,2, 4\\}\\) , then \\(A\\cap (B\\cap C) = \\{2\\}\\) The next operations on sets are: The complement of \\(A\\) , denoted \\(\\overline{A}\\) or \\(A^C\\) , is the set of all elements not contained in \\(A\\) .d The difference of \\(A\\) minus \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\setminus B\\) , is the set of all the elements in \\(A\\) but not in \\(B\\) . The symmetric difference of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\mathop{\\Delta}B\\) , is the set of all elements in either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) , but not in both. To define the complement of a set, it is assumed that there is a universal set , also called the domain of discourse, so that a set is a collection of objects from the universal set. Set Difference Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are sets. The difference between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) ( \\(A\\) minus \\(B\\) ), denoted \\(A\\setminus B\\) , is: \\[ A\\setminus B=\\{x\\ |\\ x\\in A\\text{ and } x\\not\\in B\\}. \\] Complement Suppose that \\(A\\) is a set. The complement of \\(A\\) , denoted \\(\\overline{A}\\) or \\(A^C\\) , is: \\[ \\overline{A}=\\{x\\ |\\ x\\text{ is in the universal set and } x\\not\\in A\\}. \\] Symmetric Difference Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are sets. The symmetric difference of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\mathrel{\\Delta} B\\) , is: \\[ A\\mathrel{\\Delta} B=(A-B)\\cup (B-A). \\] Example of set difference, symmetric difference and complement The following examples illustrates the operations of set difference and complement: If \\(A=\\{1,2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1, 2, 4\\}\\) , then \\(A - B=\\{ 3\\}\\) and \\(B-A=\\{4\\}\\) . If \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1\\}\\) , then \\(A - B=\\{2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B-A\\) is the empty set. If the universal set is \\(\\{0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\) and \\(A=\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) , then \\(A^C=\\{0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\) . The symmetric difference of \\(A=\\{1,2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1, 2, 4\\}\\) is \\(\\{ 3, 4\\}\\) . The symmetric difference \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1\\}\\) is \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) . Finally, it will be useful to introduce notation to represent the number of elements in a set. Cardinality The cardinality of a finite set \\(A\\) , denoted \\(|A|\\) , is the total number of elements in \\(A\\) . The notion of cardinality can be applied to infinite sets as well. However, a discussion of this is beyond the scope of these introductory notes. Additional Reading Chapter 1 of Mathematical Methods in Linguistics by Partee, Ter Meulen and Wall .

The difference between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) ( \\(A\\) minus \\(B\\) ), denoted \\(A\\setminus B\\) , is: \\[ A\\setminus B=\\{x\\ |\\ x\\in A\\text{ and } x\\not\\in B\\}. \\] Complement Suppose that \\(A\\) is a set. The complement of \\(A\\) , denoted \\(\\overline{A}\\) or \\(A^C\\) , is: \\[ \\overline{A}=\\{x\\ |\\ x\\text{ is in the universal set and } x\\not\\in A\\}. \\] Symmetric Difference Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are sets. The symmetric difference of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\mathrel{\\Delta} B\\) , is: \\[ A\\mathrel{\\Delta} B=(A-B)\\cup (B-A). \\] Example of set difference, symmetric difference and complement The following examples illustrates the operations of set difference and complement: If \\(A=\\{1,2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1, 2, 4\\}\\) , then \\(A - B=\\{ 3\\}\\) and \\(B-A=\\{4\\}\\) . If \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1\\}\\) , then \\(A - B=\\{2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B-A\\) is the empty set. If the universal set is \\(\\{0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\) and \\(A=\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) , then \\(A^C=\\{0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\) . The symmetric difference of \\(A=\\{1,2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1, 2, 4\\}\\) is \\(\\{ 3, 4\\}\\) . The symmetric difference \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1\\}\\) is \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) . Finally, it will be useful to introduce notation to represent the number of elements in a set. Cardinality The cardinality of a finite set \\(A\\) , denoted \\(|A|\\) , is the total number of elements in \\(A\\) . The notion of cardinality can be applied to infinite sets as well. However, a discussion of this is beyond the scope of these introductory notes.","title":"Operations on Sets"},{"location":"week-1/01-basic-set-theory/#additional-reading","text":"Chapter 1 of Mathematical Methods in Linguistics by Partee, Ter Meulen and Wall .

We will prove this later in the semester.","title":"Exercises"},{"location":"week-1/02-relations-and-functions/","text":"Relations and Functions Relations The order in which elements in a set are listed does not matter. That is, \\(\\{a, b\\}\\) is the same set as \\(\\{b, a\\}\\) (they both denote the set consisting of two elements ' \\(a\\) ' and ' \\(b\\) '). Similarly, listing the same element multiple times does not change a set. So, for instance, \\(\\{a,a,b\\}\\) is the same set as \\(\\{a,b\\}\\) . There are many situations in which the order in which the elements appear is important. In such situations, we use ' \\((\\) ' and ' \\()\\) '. The ordered pair , or tuple of length 2, is denoted \\((a,b)\\) . The first component is \\(a\\) and the second component is \\(b\\) . Since the order in which the elements appear matters, we have that \\((a, b)\\ne (b,a)\\) . While there is only one set with two elements \\(\\{a, b\\}\\) , there are 4 different ordered pairs that can be constructed using the elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) : \\((a, a)\\) \\((a, b)\\) \\((b, a)\\) \\((b, b)\\) Note that in the 2nd and 4th tuple we allow the same element to be repeated. Product Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are non-empty sets. The product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , denoted \\(A\\times B\\) , is the set of ordered pairs where the first component comes from \\(A\\) and the second component comes from \\(B\\) . That is, \\[ A\\times B=\\{(a,b)\\ |\\ a\\in A\\text{ and } b\\in B\\}. \\] Note that the set \\(X\\times X\\) is the product of \\(X\\) with itself, i.e., it is the set of all pairs of elements from \\(X\\) . Example Suppose that \\(X=\\{a, b, c\\}\\) and \\(Y=\\{1, 2\\}\\) . Then, \\(X\\times Y=\\{(a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,2), (c,1), (c,2)\\}.\\) \\(Y\\times X=\\{(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b), (2,c)\\}.\\) \\(X\\times X=\\{(a,a), (a,b), (a,c), (b,a), (b,b), (b,c), (c,a), (c,b), (c,c)\\}.\\) \\(\\begin{align} (X\\times X)\\times Y = &\\ \\{((a,a),1), ((a,b),1), ((a,c),1), ((b,a),1), ((b,b),1), ((b,c),1),\\\\ & \\ \\ \\ \\,((c,a),1), ((c,b),1), ((c,c),1), ((a,a),2), ((a,b),2), ((a,c),2),\\\\ & \\ \\ \\ \\, ((b,a),2), ((b,b),2), ((b,c),2),((c,a),2), ((c,b),2), ((c,c),2)\\}.\\end{align}\\) Tuples of length \\(n>2\\) Note that in item 4 of the above Example, \\((X\\times X) \\times Y\\) consists of tuples where the first component is a tuple of length 2 (where each component is from \\(X\\) ) and the second component is an element of \\(Y\\) . Often we will drop the parentheses, writing \\(X\\times X\\times Y\\) , and think of the elements of this set as tuples of length 3: \\(\\begin{align} (X\\times X)\\times Y= & \\ \\{(a,a,1), (a,b,1), (a,c,1), (b,a,1), (b,b,1), (b,c,1),(c,a,1), \\\\ &\\ \\ \\ \\,(c,b,1), (c,c,1), (a,a,2), (a,b,2), (a,c,2), (b,a,2), (b,b,2), \\\\ & \\ \\ \\ \\,(b,c,2), (c,a,2), (c,b,2), (c,c,2)\\}.\\end{align}\\) The parentheses can be recovered by associating them to the left. A relation \\(R\\) on a set \\(X\\) is a subset of \\(X\\times X\\) (the set of pairs of elements from \\(X\\) ). Formally, \\(R\\) is a relation on \\(X\\) means that \\(R\\subseteq X\\times X\\) . It is often convenient to write \\(a\\mathrel{R}b\\) for \\((a,b)\\in R\\) . To illustrate the idea of a relation, suppose that \\(X\\) is the set of people in a room. The following are two examples of relations on \\(X\\) : Suppose that \\(R\\) describes who is pointing at whome. So, \\(R\\subseteq X\\times X\\) is the relations where for \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) means that person \\(a\\) is pointing at person \\(b\\) . Suppose that \\(T\\) is the \"taller-than\" relation. So \\(T\\subseteq X\\times X\\) is the relation where for \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{T} b\\) means that person \\(a\\) is taller than person \\(b\\) . Typically, we are interested in relations satisfying special properties. Properties of relations Suppose that \\(R\\subseteq X\\times X\\) is a relation. \\(R\\) is reflexive provided that for all \\(a\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is irreflexive provided that for all \\(a\\in X\\) , it is not the case that \\(a\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is complete provided that for all \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) or \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) (or both). \\(R\\) is symmetric provided that for all \\(a,b\\in X\\) , if \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) then \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is asymmetric provided that for all \\(a,b\\in X\\) , if \\(aRb\\) then not- \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is anti-symmetric provided that for all \\(a,b \\in X\\) if \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) and \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) , then \\(a=b\\) . \\(R\\) is transitive provided that for all \\(a,b,c\\in X\\) , if \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) and \\(b\\mathrel{R} c\\) then \\(a\\mathrel{R} c\\) . Note As stated, completeness implies reflexivity (let \\(a=b\\) in the above definition of completeness). Often, completeness is defined as follows: for all distinct \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) or \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) . In what follows, we will use the above stronger definition of completeness where completeness implies reflexivity. Recall the example of a relation \\(R\\) that describes people pointing at other people in the room. If \\(R\\) is reflexive, then this means everyone is pointing at themselves. If \\(R\\) is irreflexive, then this means that no-one is pointing at themselves. This example illustrates the fact that irrelexivity is not the negation of reflexivity. That is, there are examples of relations that are neither reflexive nor irreflexive. If \\(R\\) is complete, then this means that every person in the room is either pointing at somebody or being pointed at (allowing people to point at themselves). Symmetry of \\(R\\) means that every person that is being pointed at is pointing back at the person pointing at them. Asymmetry of \\(R\\) means that nobody is pointing back at the person pointing at them. Similar to the relationship between reflexivity and irreflexivity, asymmetry is not the negation of symmetry. Picturing transitivity of the relation \\(R\\) is a bit more complicated. If the relation \\(R\\) is transitive, then everyone is pointing at the person that is being pointed to by the person that they are pointing at. Functions A function from a set \\(A\\) to a set \\(B\\) is a way of associating elements of \\(A\\) with elements of \\(B\\) . Formally, a function is a special type of relation: Function A function \\(F\\) is a binary relation on \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (i.e., \\(f\\subseteq A\\times B\\) ) such that for all \\(a\\in A\\) , there exists a unique \\(b\\in B\\) such that \\((a,b)\\in f\\) . We write \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) when \\(F\\) is a function, and if \\((a,b)\\in f\\) , then write \\(F(a)=b\\) . Example of a function Suppose that \\(A=\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{a,b\\}\\) . Examples of relations that are functions include: \\(R_1=\\{(1,a), (2,a), (3,b)\\}\\) \\(R_2=\\{(1,a), (2,a), (3,a)\\}\\) \\(R_3=\\{(1,a), (3,b)\\}\\) An example of a relation that is not a function is \\(R_4=\\{(1,a), (1,b), (3,b)\\}\\) . Suppose \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) is a function. The set \\(A\\) is called the domain and \\(B\\) is called the codomain . The following standard notions are usefule for reasoning about and with functions. Image Suppose that \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) . The image of a set \\(A'\\subseteq A\\) is the set: \\[ F(A')=\\{b\\ |\\ b=F(a) \\text{ for some }a\\in A'\\} \\] Range The range of a function is the image of its domain. Surjection A function \\(F\\) is a surjection (or onto) if its range is equal to its codomain. I.e., \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) is surjective when for each \\(b\\in B\\) , there exists an \\(a\\in A\\) such that \\(F(a)=b\\) Injection A function \\(F\\) is an injection (or 1-1) if distinct elements of the domain produce distinct elements of the codomain. I.e., \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) is 1-1 when for all \\(a,a'\\in A\\) , \\(a\\ne a'\\) implies \\(F(a)\\ne F(a')\\) , or equivalently \\(F(a)=F(a')\\) implies \\(a=a'\\) . Bijection A function \\(F\\) is a bijection if it is injective and surjective. In this case, \\(F\\) is often called a one-to-one correspondence. Inverse Image Suppose that \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) and that \\(Y\\subseteq B\\) . The inverse image of \\(Y\\) is the set \\[ F^{-1}(Y)=\\{x\\ |\\ x\\in A\\text{ and } F(x)\\in Y\\}. \\] Function on the powerset Suppose that \\(X=\\{a, b, c\\}\\) . A function from non-empty subsets of \\(X\\) to non-empty subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(F:(\\wp(X)-\\emptyset) \\rightarrow (\\wp(X)-\\emptyset)\\) . An example of such a function is: \\[ \\begin{align} F(\\{a\\}) & = & \\{a\\}\\\\[2pt] F(\\{b\\}) & = & \\{b\\}\\\\[2pt] F(\\{c\\}) & = & \\{c\\}\\\\[2pt] F(\\{a,b\\}) & = & \\{a\\}\\\\[2pt] F(\\{a,c\\}) & = & \\{c\\}\\\\[2pt] F(\\{b,c\\}) & = & \\{b\\}\\\\[2pt] F(\\{a,b,c\\}) & = & \\{b,c\\}\\\\[2pt] \\end{align} \\] Sequences A sequence is an enumerated list of elements. For instance, \\((b, a, c, b)\\) is a sequence of length 4. Above, this mathematical object was called a tuple of length 4 . It will be convenient to view a sequence as a function from an index set to some set of objects. For example, the sequence \\((b, a, c, b)\\) can be viewed as a function \\(s:\\{0,1,2,3\\} \\rightarrow\\{a,b,c\\}\\) where \\(s(0)=b\\) , \\(s(1)=a\\) , \\(s(2)=c\\) and \\(s(3)=b\\) . Conversely, a function \\(s:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow A\\) can be viewed as a (possibly infinite) sequence of elements from \\(A\\) . When the function \\(s\\) is viewed as a sequence, we write \\(s_i\\) for \\(s(i)\\) . Additional Reading Chapter 2 of Mathematical Methods in Linguistics by Partee, Ter Meulen and Wall .

Show Answer \\(\\varnothing \\times A = \\varnothing\\) Consider the relation \\(R = \\{(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (d,d), (a,b), (b,a)\\}\\) on the set \\(A=\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) . Determined which of the following properties are satisfied by \\(R\\) : Reflexive Symmetric Transitive Show Answer \\(R\\) is reflexive. \\(R\\) is symmetric. \\(R\\) is transitive. Consider the relation \\(R = \\{(a,b), (a,c), (c,c), (b,b), (c,b), (b,c)\\}\\) on the set \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) . Determined which of the following properties are satisfied by \\(R\\) : Reflexive Symmetric Transitive Show Answer \\(R\\) is not reflexive. This follows since \\((a,a)\\not\\in R\\) \\(R\\) is not symmetric. This follows since \\((a,b)\\in R\\) but \\((b,a)\\not\\in R\\) . \\(R\\) is transitive. Let \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) be transitive relations on a set \\(A\\) . Does it follow that \\(R\\cup S\\) is transitive? (Explain your answer.) Show Answer No. Suppose that \\(R=\\{(a,b)\\}\\) and \\(S=\\{(b,c)\\}\\) . Both \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are transitive; however, \\(R\\cup S=\\{(a,b),(b,c)\\}\\) is not transitive. Suppose \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are transitive relations on the set \\(A\\) . Is \\(R \\cap S\\) transitive? (Explain your answer.) Show Answer Yes. Suppose that \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are transitive relations. Let \\(x\\mathrel{R\\cap S} y\\) and \\(y\\mathrel{R\\cap S} z\\) (i.e., \\((x,y),(y,z)\\in R\\cap S\\) ). Then, we have 1) \\(x\\mathrel{R} y\\) and \\(y\\mathrel{R}z\\) ; and 2) \\(x\\mathrel{S} y\\) and \\(y\\mathrel{S}z\\) . Since \\(R\\) is transitive, 1) implies that \\(x\\mathrel{R}z\\) ; and since \\(S\\) is transitive, 2) implies that \\(x\\mathrel{S}z\\) . Thus, \\(x\\mathrel{R\\cap S} z\\) , as desired. Suppose that \\(A\\ne\\varnothing\\) . Since \\(\\varnothing \\subseteq A\\times A\\) , then \\(R=\\varnothing\\) is a relation on \\(A\\) . Is \\(R\\) reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? If a property does not hold, say why. Show Answer \\(R\\) is not reflexive. Since \\(A\\ne \\varnothing\\) , there is some \\(a\\in A\\) . However, \\((a,a)\\not\\in \\varnothing\\) . \\(R\\) is symmetric. \\(R\\) is transitive. Suppose that \\(X=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) and \\(Y=\\{e, f, g\\}\\) .

Show Answer Let \\(F:X\\rightarrow Y\\) be the funciton where where \\(F(a)=e\\) , \\(F(b)=f\\) and \\(F(c)=e\\) . Suppose that \\(X=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) and \\(Y=\\{e, f, g\\}\\) . Give an example of an injective and surjective function from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) Show Answer Let \\(F:X\\rightarrow Y\\) be the function where where \\(F(a)=e\\) , \\(F(b)=f\\) and \\(F(c)=g\\) Suppose that \\(Y=\\{e, f, g\\}\\) and \\(Z=\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) . Can you find a surjective function from \\(Y\\) to \\(Z\\) ? If yes, give an example and if no, explain why not. Show Answer No, there is no surjective function from \\(Y\\) to \\(Z\\) . The reason is that \\(Z\\) has more elements that \\(Y\\) . If \\(F:Y\\rightarrow Z\\) is a surjective function, then for each \\(z\\in Z\\) , there is some \\(y\\in Y\\) such that \\(F(y)=z\\) .

That is, \\(\\{a, b\\}\\) is the same set as \\(\\{b, a\\}\\) (they both denote the set consisting of two elements ' \\(a\\) ' and ' \\(b\\) '). Similarly, listing the same element multiple times does not change a set. So, for instance, \\(\\{a,a,b\\}\\) is the same set as \\(\\{a,b\\}\\) . There are many situations in which the order in which the elements appear is important. In such situations, we use ' \\((\\) ' and ' \\()\\) '. The ordered pair , or tuple of length 2, is denoted \\((a,b)\\) . The first component is \\(a\\) and the second component is \\(b\\) . Since the order in which the elements appear matters, we have that \\((a, b)\\ne (b,a)\\) . While there is only one set with two elements \\(\\{a, b\\}\\) , there are 4 different ordered pairs that can be constructed using the elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) : \\((a, a)\\) \\((a, b)\\) \\((b, a)\\) \\((b, b)\\) Note that in the 2nd and 4th tuple we allow the same element to be repeated. Product Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are non-empty sets.

A relation \\(R\\) on a set \\(X\\) is a subset of \\(X\\times X\\) (the set of pairs of elements from \\(X\\) ). Formally, \\(R\\) is a relation on \\(X\\) means that \\(R\\subseteq X\\times X\\) . It is often convenient to write \\(a\\mathrel{R}b\\) for \\((a,b)\\in R\\) . To illustrate the idea of a relation, suppose that \\(X\\) is the set of people in a room. The following are two examples of relations on \\(X\\) : Suppose that \\(R\\) describes who is pointing at whome. So, \\(R\\subseteq X\\times X\\) is the relations where for \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) means that person \\(a\\) is pointing at person \\(b\\) . Suppose that \\(T\\) is the \"taller-than\" relation. So \\(T\\subseteq X\\times X\\) is the relation where for \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{T} b\\) means that person \\(a\\) is taller than person \\(b\\) . Typically, we are interested in relations satisfying special properties. Properties of relations Suppose that \\(R\\subseteq X\\times X\\) is a relation. \\(R\\) is reflexive provided that for all \\(a\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is irreflexive provided that for all \\(a\\in X\\) , it is not the case that \\(a\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is complete provided that for all \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) or \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) (or both). \\(R\\) is symmetric provided that for all \\(a,b\\in X\\) , if \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) then \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is asymmetric provided that for all \\(a,b\\in X\\) , if \\(aRb\\) then not- \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) . \\(R\\) is anti-symmetric provided that for all \\(a,b \\in X\\) if \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) and \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) , then \\(a=b\\) . \\(R\\) is transitive provided that for all \\(a,b,c\\in X\\) , if \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) and \\(b\\mathrel{R} c\\) then \\(a\\mathrel{R} c\\) . Note As stated, completeness implies reflexivity (let \\(a=b\\) in the above definition of completeness). Often, completeness is defined as follows: for all distinct \\(a,b\\in X\\) , \\(a\\mathrel{R} b\\) or \\(b\\mathrel{R} a\\) . In what follows, we will use the above stronger definition of completeness where completeness implies reflexivity. Recall the example of a relation \\(R\\) that describes people pointing at other people in the room. If \\(R\\) is reflexive, then this means everyone is pointing at themselves. If \\(R\\) is irreflexive, then this means that no-one is pointing at themselves. This example illustrates the fact that irrelexivity is not the negation of reflexivity. That is, there are examples of relations that are neither reflexive nor irreflexive. If \\(R\\) is complete, then this means that every person in the room is either pointing at somebody or being pointed at (allowing people to point at themselves). Symmetry of \\(R\\) means that every person that is being pointed at is pointing back at the person pointing at them. Asymmetry of \\(R\\) means that nobody is pointing back at the person pointing at them. Similar to the relationship between reflexivity and irreflexivity, asymmetry is not the negation of symmetry. Picturing transitivity of the relation \\(R\\) is a bit more complicated. If the relation \\(R\\) is transitive, then everyone is pointing at the person that is being pointed to by the person that they are pointing at.","title":"Relations"},{"location":"week-1/02-relations-and-functions/#functions","text":"A function from a set \\(A\\) to a set \\(B\\) is a way of associating elements of \\(A\\) with elements of \\(B\\) .

The image of a set \\(A'\\subseteq A\\) is the set: \\[ F(A')=\\{b\\ |\\ b=F(a) \\text{ for some }a\\in A'\\} \\] Range The range of a function is the image of its domain. Surjection A function \\(F\\) is a surjection (or onto) if its range is equal to its codomain. I.e., \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) is surjective when for each \\(b\\in B\\) , there exists an \\(a\\in A\\) such that \\(F(a)=b\\) Injection A function \\(F\\) is an injection (or 1-1) if distinct elements of the domain produce distinct elements of the codomain. I.e., \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) is 1-1 when for all \\(a,a'\\in A\\) , \\(a\\ne a'\\) implies \\(F(a)\\ne F(a')\\) , or equivalently \\(F(a)=F(a')\\) implies \\(a=a'\\) . Bijection A function \\(F\\) is a bijection if it is injective and surjective. In this case, \\(F\\) is often called a one-to-one correspondence. Inverse Image Suppose that \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) and that \\(Y\\subseteq B\\) .

A function from non-empty subsets of \\(X\\) to non-empty subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(F:(\\wp(X)-\\emptyset) \\rightarrow (\\wp(X)-\\emptyset)\\) .

It will be convenient to view a sequence as a function from an index set to some set of objects. For example, the sequence \\((b, a, c, b)\\) can be viewed as a function \\(s:\\{0,1,2,3\\} \\rightarrow\\{a,b,c\\}\\) where \\(s(0)=b\\) , \\(s(1)=a\\) , \\(s(2)=c\\) and \\(s(3)=b\\) .

A proof of a mathematical statement is an explanation of that statement using appropriate notation and terminology . It is very important that you become comfortable with the definitions. If you don't know or understand the formal definitions, then you will not be able to write down your explanations. It would be like trying to explain something to someone in Italian without actually knowing Italian. During this semester, you will read and write mathematical proofs about logical systems. In this tutorial, we will introduce the basics of writing proofs about sets. The notation \" \\(x \\in X\\) \", \" \\(x\\not\\in X\\) \", \" \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) \", \" \\(X\\not\\subseteq Y\\) \" and \" \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) \" are statements which may be true or false depending on what \\(x\\) , \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) refer to. The following table summarizes this notation and how to prove that the statement is true. Notation Description To prove \\(x\\in X\\) \\(x\\) is an element of \\(X\\) Prove that \\(x\\) is listed in \\(X\\) or \\(x\\) has the property used to define the elements in \\(X\\) . \\(x\\not\\in X\\) \\(x\\) is not an element of \\(X\\) Prove that \\(x\\) is not listed in \\(X\\) , or \\(x\\) does not have the property used to define the elements in \\(X\\) . \\(X = Y\\) \\(X\\) equals \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) contain the same elements. \\(X\\ne Y\\) \\(X\\) is not equal to \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) do not contain the same elements. \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) \\(X\\) is a subset of \\(Y\\) Prove that every element of \\(X\\) is an element of \\(Y\\) , or there is no element of \\(X\\) that is not an element of \\(Y\\) . \\(X\\not\\subseteq Y\\) \\(X\\) is not a subset of \\(Y\\) Prove that there is some element of \\(X\\) that is not an element of \\(Y\\) . \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) \\(X\\) is a proper subset of \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) and there is some element of \\(Y\\) that is not an element of \\(X\\) . \\(X\\subset Y\\) Same as \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) Same as \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) . \\(X = Y\\) \\(X\\) equals \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) and \\(Y\\subseteq X\\) . How do you prove that two sets are equal? The answer to this question partly depends on who you are trying to convince. In this class, we will err on the side of caution and given fairly detailed proofs. Fact . For all sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , \\(A=B\\) if and only if \\(A\\subseteq B\\) and \\(B\\subseteq A\\) . Why is this true? Well, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal, then they both name the same collection of objects. I.e., \\(B\\) is another name for the collection of objects that \\(A\\) names and vice versa. So, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal then of course \\(A\\subseteq B\\) since \\(A\\) is always a subset of itself and \\(B\\) is simply another name for \\(A\\) . Similarly, we can show \\(B\\subseteq A\\) . Conversely, suppose \\(A\\subseteq B\\) and \\(B\\subseteq A\\) . We want to know that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) name the same collection of objects. Suppose they didn't, then there should be some \\(x\\in A\\) such that \\(x\\not\\in B\\) or some \\(y\\in B\\) such that \\(y\\not\\in A\\) . Since \\(A\\subseteq B\\) , every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(B\\) so there is no \\(x\\in A\\) such that \\(x\\not\\in B\\) . Similarly, since \\(B\\subseteq A\\) , there is no \\(y\\in B\\) such that \\(y\\not\\in A\\) . Hence, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be the same set of objects. What about trying to prove that two sets are not equal (i.e., \\(A\\neq B\\) )? This turns out to be easier. In order to show that \\(A\\) does not equal \\(B\\) , you need only find an element in \\(A\\) that is not in \\(B\\) or an element of \\(B\\) that is not in \\(A\\) . Showing two sets are equal reduces to proving that the sets are subsets of each other. But, how to show that a set is a subset of another set? The general procedure to show \\(A\\subseteq B\\) is to show that each element of \\(A\\) is also and element of \\(B\\) . This is straightforward if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both finite sets. For example, suppose \\(A=\\{2,3,4\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) . How do we show that \\(A\\subseteq B\\) . Since \\(A\\) is finite, we simply notice that \\(2\\in B\\) , \\(3\\in B\\) and \\(4\\in B\\) . What if \\(A\\) is the set of even numbers and \\(B\\) is the set of all integers? We would get awfully tired (and bored) if we waited around to show that each and every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\) . Imagine \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two boxes, and you would like to know whether all the elements in \\(A\\) 's box are also in \\(B\\) 's box. Suppose you reach in box \\(A\\) and select an element, say the number 10. After inspecting 10, you notice that 10 is in fact an integer and so must also be an element of box \\(B\\) . But you are not satisfied, since you cannot be sure that the next element you choose from \\(A\\) will also be an element of \\(B\\) . In fact, even if you have shown that the first million even integers are all members of box \\(B\\) , you cannot be sure that the next element you select from box \\(A\\) will in fact be an integer. Instead, you should consider the property that all elements of \\(A\\) have in common and show that any object satisfying that property must be an element of \\(B\\) . If \\(x\\in A\\) , then \\(x\\) is an even number, so \\(x=2\\cdot n\\) , where \\(n\\) is some integer. Then, since if \\(n\\) is an integer, then \\(2\\cdot n\\) is also an integer; we must have that every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\) . Later in the semester we will learn other techniques for proving statements about infinite sets. Examples In this section, we give two examples of mathematical proofs. Claim 1. For all sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , \\(\\overline{A}\\cup \\overline{B}=\\overline{A\\cap B}\\) . Proof .

QED Venn Diagrams A Venn diagram is a picture that represents all the possible relationships between sets. For example, the following pictures represents all the possible relationships between two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) : A Venn diagram. There are 4 distinct regions in the above picture: region \\(1\\) is for items that are not in \\(A\\) and not in \\(B\\) ; region \\(2\\) is for items in \\(A\\) that are not in \\(B\\) ; region \\(3\\) is for items in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) ; and region \\(4\\) is for items that are not in \\(A\\) and are in \\(B\\) . It is important to remember that in Venn diagrams, some of the regions might be empty, i.e., the region does not contain any elements. For example, if \\(A\\subseteq B\\) , region \\(2\\) does not contain any elements (since every element in \\(A\\) is in \\(B\\) ). To represent this subset relation between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) we can draw the \\(A\\) region inside the \\(B\\) region: Techincally, this is called a Euler diagram. Eurler diagrams do not represent the regions that are known to be empty. Subset Typically, one shades a region corresponding to a set in a Venn diagram. For example, the 4 regions described above are shaded as follows (each region is labeled with the corresponding set): The 4 regions of a Venn diagram . Shading multiple regions in a Venn diagram corresponds to different ways to combine sets using union, intersection, complement, set difference, and symmetric difference. Since there are 4 different regions for two sets, there are 16 different ways to shade these regions (since any subset of the set of 4 regions can be shaded, recall that if \\(X\\) is a set with 4 elements, then the powerset has \\(2^4=16\\) elements). The next Figure shows all of the 16 possible shaded regions for two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) labeled with the corresponding set.

QED","title":"Introduction to Proofs"},{"location":"week-1/03-introduction-proofs/#introduction-to-proofs","text":"Learning how to write mathematical proofs takes time and lots of practice. A proof of a mathematical statement is an explanation of that statement using appropriate notation and terminology . It is very important that you become comfortable with the definitions. If you don't know or understand the formal definitions, then you will not be able to write down your explanations. It would be like trying to explain something to someone in Italian without actually knowing Italian. During this semester, you will read and write mathematical proofs about logical systems. In this tutorial, we will introduce the basics of writing proofs about sets. The notation \" \\(x \\in X\\) \", \" \\(x\\not\\in X\\) \", \" \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) \", \" \\(X\\not\\subseteq Y\\) \" and \" \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) \" are statements which may be true or false depending on what \\(x\\) , \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) refer to. The following table summarizes this notation and how to prove that the statement is true. Notation Description To prove \\(x\\in X\\) \\(x\\) is an element of \\(X\\) Prove that \\(x\\) is listed in \\(X\\) or \\(x\\) has the property used to define the elements in \\(X\\) . \\(x\\not\\in X\\) \\(x\\) is not an element of \\(X\\) Prove that \\(x\\) is not listed in \\(X\\) , or \\(x\\) does not have the property used to define the elements in \\(X\\) . \\(X = Y\\) \\(X\\) equals \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) contain the same elements. \\(X\\ne Y\\) \\(X\\) is not equal to \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) do not contain the same elements. \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) \\(X\\) is a subset of \\(Y\\) Prove that every element of \\(X\\) is an element of \\(Y\\) , or there is no element of \\(X\\) that is not an element of \\(Y\\) . \\(X\\not\\subseteq Y\\) \\(X\\) is not a subset of \\(Y\\) Prove that there is some element of \\(X\\) that is not an element of \\(Y\\) . \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) \\(X\\) is a proper subset of \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) and there is some element of \\(Y\\) that is not an element of \\(X\\) . \\(X\\subset Y\\) Same as \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) Same as \\(X\\subsetneq Y\\) . \\(X = Y\\) \\(X\\) equals \\(Y\\) Prove that \\(X\\subseteq Y\\) and \\(Y\\subseteq X\\) . How do you prove that two sets are equal? The answer to this question partly depends on who you are trying to convince. In this class, we will err on the side of caution and given fairly detailed proofs. Fact . For all sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) , \\(A=B\\) if and only if \\(A\\subseteq B\\) and \\(B\\subseteq A\\) . Why is this true? Well, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal, then they both name the same collection of objects. I.e., \\(B\\) is another name for the collection of objects that \\(A\\) names and vice versa. So, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal then of course \\(A\\subseteq B\\) since \\(A\\) is always a subset of itself and \\(B\\) is simply another name for \\(A\\) . Similarly, we can show \\(B\\subseteq A\\) . Conversely, suppose \\(A\\subseteq B\\) and \\(B\\subseteq A\\) . We want to know that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) name the same collection of objects. Suppose they didn't, then there should be some \\(x\\in A\\) such that \\(x\\not\\in B\\) or some \\(y\\in B\\) such that \\(y\\not\\in A\\) . Since \\(A\\subseteq B\\) , every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(B\\) so there is no \\(x\\in A\\) such that \\(x\\not\\in B\\) . Similarly, since \\(B\\subseteq A\\) , there is no \\(y\\in B\\) such that \\(y\\not\\in A\\) . Hence, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be the same set of objects. What about trying to prove that two sets are not equal (i.e., \\(A\\neq B\\) )? This turns out to be easier. In order to show that \\(A\\) does not equal \\(B\\) , you need only find an element in \\(A\\) that is not in \\(B\\) or an element of \\(B\\) that is not in \\(A\\) . Showing two sets are equal reduces to proving that the sets are subsets of each other. But, how to show that a set is a subset of another set? The general procedure to show \\(A\\subseteq B\\) is to show that each element of \\(A\\) is also and element of \\(B\\) . This is straightforward if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both finite sets. For example, suppose \\(A=\\{2,3,4\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) . How do we show that \\(A\\subseteq B\\) . Since \\(A\\) is finite, we simply notice that \\(2\\in B\\) , \\(3\\in B\\) and \\(4\\in B\\) . What if \\(A\\) is the set of even numbers and \\(B\\) is the set of all integers? We would get awfully tired (and bored) if we waited around to show that each and every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\) . Imagine \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two boxes, and you would like to know whether all the elements in \\(A\\) 's box are also in \\(B\\) 's box. Suppose you reach in box \\(A\\) and select an element, say the number 10. After inspecting 10, you notice that 10 is in fact an integer and so must also be an element of box \\(B\\) . But you are not satisfied, since you cannot be sure that the next element you choose from \\(A\\) will also be an element of \\(B\\) . In fact, even if you have shown that the first million even integers are all members of box \\(B\\) , you cannot be sure that the next element you select from box \\(A\\) will in fact be an integer. Instead, you should consider the property that all elements of \\(A\\) have in common and show that any object satisfying that property must be an element of \\(B\\) . If \\(x\\in A\\) , then \\(x\\) is an even number, so \\(x=2\\cdot n\\) , where \\(n\\) is some integer. Then, since if \\(n\\) is an integer, then \\(2\\cdot n\\) is also an integer; we must have that every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\) . Later in the semester we will learn other techniques for proving statements about infinite sets.","title":"Introduction to Proofs"},{"location":"week-1/03-introduction-proofs/#examples","text":"In this section, we give two examples of mathematical proofs.

Let \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) . Lef \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) be defined as follows: \\(F(1)=c\\) , \\(F(2)=b\\) and \\(F(3)=c\\) . Now, let \\(X=\\{1,2\\}\\) and \\(Y=\\{2,3\\}\\) . Then \\(X\\cap Y=\\{2\\}\\) and \\[ F(X\\cap Y)=F(\\{2\\})=\\{F(2)\\}=\\{b\\}. \\] But, we also have that: \\[ F(X)\\cap F(Y)=\\{F(1),F(2)\\}\\cap \\{F(2),F(3)\\}=\\{c,b\\}\\cap \\{b,c\\}=\\{b,c\\} \\] Hence, \\(F(X\\cap Y)\\neq F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\) . QED Note It is true that for any function \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) and all subsets \\(X,Y\\subseteq A\\) , \\(F(X\\cap Y)\\subseteq F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\) (for a proof see below). Suppose that \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) . Prove or disprove the following: If \\(X\\subseteq A\\) , \\(Y\\subseteq A\\) and \\(F\\) is injenctive,then \\(F(X\\cap Y)=F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\) . Answer Claim . If \\(X\\subseteq A\\) , \\(Y\\subseteq A\\) and \\(F\\) is injenctive,then \\(F(X\\cap Y)=F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\) . Proof . Suppose that \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) is a 1-1 function. Let \\(X\\subseteq A\\) and \\(Y\\subseteq A\\) . We must show that (1) \\(F(X\\cap Y)\\subseteq F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\) and (2) \\(F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\subseteq F(X\\cap Y)\\) . Notice that (1) is true even if \\(F\\) is not 1-1. Let \\(y\\in F(X\\cap Y)\\) . Then there is an element \\(x\\in X\\cap Y\\) such that \\(F(x)=y\\) . Since \\(x\\in X\\cap Y\\) , \\(x\\in X\\) and \\(x\\in Y\\) . Therefore, \\(y=F(x)\\in F(X)\\) and \\(y=F(x)\\in F(Y)\\) . Hence, \\(y\\in F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\) . We now prove (2). Let \\(y\\in F(X)\\cap F(Y)\\) . Then \\(y\\in F(X)\\) and \\(y\\in F(Y)\\) . Since \\(y\\in F(X)\\) there is \\(x_1\\in X\\) such that \\(F(x_1)=y\\) . Since \\(y\\in F(Y)\\) , there is \\(x_2\\in Y\\) such that \\(F(x_2)=y\\) . Since \\(F\\) is 1-1, \\(x_1=x_2\\) . Therefore \\(x_1=x_2\\in X\\cap Y\\) ; and so, \\(y=F(x_1)=F(x_2)\\in F(X\\cap Y)\\) . QED Suppose that \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) . Prove or disprove the following: If \\(X\\subseteq B\\) and \\(Y\\subseteq B\\) , then \\(F^{-1}(X\\cap Y)=F^{-1}(X)\\cap F^{-1}(Y)\\) . Answer Claim If \\(X\\subseteq B\\) and \\(Y\\subseteq B\\) , then \\(F^{-1}(X\\cap Y)=f^{-1}(X)\\cap F^{-1}(Y)\\) . Proof . Let \\(F:A\\rightarrow B\\) be any function and suppose \\(X\\subseteq B\\) and \\(Y\\subseteq B\\) . We must show \\(F^{-1}(X\\cap Y)\\subseteq F^{-1}(X)\\cap F^{-1}(Y)\\) and \\(F^{-1}(X)\\cap F^{-1}(Y)\\subseteq F^{-1}(X\\cap Y)\\) . Suppose that \\(x\\in F^{-1}(X\\cap Y)\\) . Then \\(F(x)\\in X\\cap Y\\) . Hence \\(F(x)\\in X\\) and \\(F(x)\\in Y\\) . Since \\(F(x)\\in X\\) , \\(x\\in f^{-1}(X)\\) . Since \\(F(x)\\in Y\\) , \\(x\\in f^{-1}(Y)\\) . Therefore, \\(x\\in F^{-1}(X)\\cap F^{-1}(Y)\\) . Suppose that \\(x\\in F^{-1}(X)\\cap F^{-1}(Y)\\) . Then \\(x\\in F^{-1}(X)\\) and \\(x\\in F^{-1}(Y)\\) . Therefore, \\(F(x)\\in X\\) and \\(F(x)\\in Y\\) . Hence, \\(F(x)\\in X\\cap Y\\) ; and so, \\(x\\in F^{-1}(X\\cap Y)\\) .

A tree is a tuple \\((T, E)\\) , where \\(T\\) is a nonempty set, whose elements are called nodes , and \\(E\\) is a relation on \\(T\\) , \\(E\\subseteq T\\times T\\) , called the immediate edge relation , satisfying the following conditions: For all nodes, \\(n, n', m\\in T\\) , Every node has a unique predecessor: If \\(nEm\\) and \\(n' Em\\) , then \\(n=n'\\) , There are no cycles: If \\((n_1,\\ldots, n_k)\\) is a sequence of nodes where for each \\(i=1,\\ldots, k-1\\) , \\(n_iEn_{i+1}\\) , then \\(n_1\\ne n_k\\) , and Between any two nodes there is a unique path: For each \\(n, n'\\in T\\) there is a unique sequence \\(n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_m\\) such that \\(n=n_1En_2\\cdots En_m=n'\\) . The following terminology will be used when talking about trees. Let \\((T, E)\\) be a tree. For a node \\(n\\in T\\) , the successors or children of \\(n\\) are \\(\\{n'\\ |\\ nEn'\\}\\) . For a node \\(n\\in T\\) , the predecessor or parent of \\(n\\) is the set \\(\\{n'\\ |\\ n'En\\}\\) . Note that this set contains either no elements or exactly one element. A node \\(n\\in T\\) is called the root of the tree when the set of predecessors of \\(n\\) is \\(\\varnothing\\) . The arity of a node is the number of successors. The leaves of a tree are the nodes with no successors (i.e., the nodes with arity 0). A path in \\((T,E)\\) is a sequence of nodes connected by an edge relation: that is, a path is a sequence \\((n_1,n_2,\\ldots, n_k)\\) such that for each \\(i=1,\\ldots,k-1\\) , \\(n_iEn_{i+1}\\) . The length of a path is equal to the number of edges along that path (equivalently, one minus the number of nodes). The height of \\((T,E)\\) is the length of the longest path. As an example, let \\(T\\) and \\(E\\) be defined as follows: \\[ T=\\{n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6, n_7, n_8\\} \\] \\[ E=\\{(n_1,n_2), (n_1,n_3), (n_3, n_4), (n_3, n_5), (n_3, n_6), (n_2, n_7), (n_6, n_8)\\} \\] We can depict this tree as follows: The root of the above tree is \\(n_1\\) The leaves are \\(n_8, n_5, n_4,\\) and \\(n_7\\) . The successors of \\(n_3\\) are \\(\\{n_6,n_5, n_4\\}\\) and the predecessor of \\(n_3\\) is \\(\\{n_1\\}\\) . An example of two paths in the tree are \\((n_3,n_5)\\) and \\((n_1,n_3,n_6)\\) . The height of the tree is 3: the longest path in the tree is \\((n_1,n_3,n_6, n_8)\\) which has length 3. Warning We defined the predecessor of a node as a set, but the set will consist of either no elements (if the node is a root) or a single element (since every node as at most one predecessor). So, we will often say, for instance, \"the parent of \\(n_3\\) is \\(n_1\\) \". A labelling of a tree \\((T,E)\\) is a function \\(f\\) defined on the set of nodes de\ufb01ned on the set of nodes \\(T\\) . The labelling \\(f\\) is a right labelling when we write \\(f(n)\\) to the right of eacn node \\(n\\) , and a left labelling when we write \\(f(n)\\) to the left of each noe \\(n\\) .

For instance, if \\(E(n)\\) means that \\(n\\) is an even number, then \\(E(4)\\) is true but \\(E(5)\\) is false. Suppose that you want to prove all natural numbers greater than or equal to \\(m\\) have some property \\(P\\) . That is, you want to prove that \\(P(n)\\) is true for all \\(n\\ge m\\ge 0\\) . To prove this by induction, you must prove the following two statements: Base case : \\(P(m)\\) is true. Induction step : For all \\(k\\ge m\\) , if \\(P(k)\\) is true, then \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. After proving the above two statements, you can conclude \"Therefore, \\(P(n)\\) is true for all \\(n\\ge m\\) by induction. Note Statement 2 is a conditional. To prove this statement, consider an arbitrary \\(k\\ge m\\) and assume that \\(P(k)\\) is true. Then, you must verify that \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. The statement \\(P(k)\\) is called the induction hypothesis . Claim 1 . For all \\(n\\ge 1\\) , \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)=n^2\\) . Proof. The proof is by induction. Base case: The base case is \\(n=1\\) . We have that \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^1 (2i-1)= 2*1-1 - 1 = 1^2. \\] The induction hypothesis is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k (2i-1)=k^2\\) . We must show that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i-1)=(k+1)^2\\) . This is proved as follows: \\[ \\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i-1) & = & \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i-1) + (2(k+1)-1)\\\\ & = & k^2 + 2k + 2 - 1\\\\ & = & k^2 + 2k + 1\\\\ & = & (k+1)^2 \\end{align} \\] Therefore, by induction for all \\(n\\ge 1\\) , \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)=n^2\\) . QED Strong Induction To prove that for all \\(n\\ge m\\ge 0\\) , \\(P(n)\\) by strong induction , you must prove the following two statements: Base case : \\(P(m)\\) is true. Induction step : Assume that \\(P(k)\\) is true for all \\(k < n\\) . Prove that \\(P(n)\\) is true. Claim 2 . Any positive integer \\(n\\) can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers. Proof . The proof using strong induction on \\(n\\) . The base case is \\(n=1\\) . Clearly, \\(1\\) can be expressed as an empty product of prime numbers. Suppose that for any \\(1< k< n\\) , \\(k\\) can be written as a product of primes. We must show that \\(n\\) can be written as a product of primes. There are two cases: 1. \\(n\\) is prime or 2. \\(n\\) is not prime. If \\(n\\) is prime, then \\(n\\) can be expressed as the product of 1 prime number (namely \\(n\\) itself). If \\(n\\) is not prime, then \\(n=ab\\) where $a\\ge 2 and \\(b\\ge 2\\) . Since \\(a< n\\) and \\(b< n\\) , by the induction hypothesis, both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be written as a product of primes. Then, \\(n=ab\\) can also be written as a product of primes. QED Weak and Strong Induction Note that the above proof used strong induction rather than weak induction. We did not argue that if \\(k\\) is the product of primes, then so is \\(k+1\\) . When we noted that \\(n=ab\\) in the above proof, all we can conclude is that \\(a< n\\) and \\(b< n\\) . We then apply strong induction. See this discussion for further discussion of weak and strong induction. Inductive Definitions and Structural Induction Consider the following definition: Nice Terms The set of nice terms is inductively defined as follows: Any letter \\(\\mathrm{a}\\) , \\(\\mathrm{b}\\) , \\(\\mathrm{c}\\) , \\(\\mathrm{d}\\) is a nice term. If \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) are nice terms, then so is \\([s \\circ s']\\) . Nothing else is a nice term. Examples of nice terms. The following are examples of nice terms include: \\(\\mathrm{a}\\) , \\([\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\) , \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{b}]\\circ [\\mathrm{c}\\circ\\mathrm{d}]]\\) , \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\circ[\\mathrm{b}\\circ[\\mathrm{c}\\circ[\\mathrm{d}\\circ\\mathrm{a}]]]]\\) . The length of a nice term is the number characters in the term. Note that we have the following The length of \\(\\mathrm{a}\\) is 1 and there are 0 occurrences of \\([\\) , The length of \\([\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\) is 5 and there is 1 occurrence of \\([\\) , The length of \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{b}]\\circ [\\mathrm{c}\\circ\\mathrm{d}]]\\) is 13 and there is 3 occurrences of \\([\\) , The length of \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\circ[\\mathrm{b}\\circ[\\mathrm{c}\\circ[\\mathrm{d}\\circ\\mathrm{a}]]]]\\) is 21 and there are 5 occurrences of \\([\\) . Notice that in each case, the number of occurrences of \\([\\) in a nice term is strictly less than \\(n/2\\) where \\(n\\) the length of the term. This is not necessarily true if an expression is not a nice term: The length of \\([[[[a\\circ b\\) is 6, but there are \\(4>6/2\\) occurrences of \\([\\) . Claim 3 . For any \\(n\\) , the number of \\([\\) in a nice term of length \\(n\\) is \\(< n/2\\) . Proof . We prove the statement by strong induction on the length of a nice term. A term of length 1 has 0 occurrences of the symbol ' \\([\\) ', so the statement holds for \\(n=1\\) . We must show the following conditional claim is true: If for every \\(k < n\\) , any nice term of length \\(k\\) has \\(k/2\\) \\([\\) 's, then any nice term of length \\(n\\) has \\(n/2\\) \\([\\) 's. To show this conditional, assume that for any \\(k< n\\) , nice terms of length \\(k\\) contain less than \\(k/2\\) occurrences of \\([\\) . This assumption is called the inductive hypothesis. We want to show the same is true for nice terms of length \\(n\\) . So suppose \\(t\\) is a nice term of length \\(n\\) . Because nice terms are inductively defined, we have two cases: (1) \\(t\\) is a letter by itself, or \\(t\\) is \\([s \\circ s']\\) for some nice terms \\(s\\) and~ \\(s'\\) . \\(t\\) is a letter. Then \\(n = 1\\) , and the number of \\([\\) in \\(t\\) is \\(0\\) . Since \\(0 < 1/2\\) , the claim holds. \\(t\\) is \\([s \\circ s']\\) for some nice terms \\(s\\) and~ \\(s'\\) . Let \\(k\\) be the length of \\(s\\) and \\(k'\\) be the length of \\(s'\\) . Then the length \\(n\\) of \\(t\\) is \\(k+k'+3\\) (the lengths of \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) plus three symbols \\([\\) , \\(\\circ\\) , \\(]\\) ). Since \\(k+k'+3\\) is always greater than \\(k\\) , \\(k < n\\) . Similarly, \\(k' < n\\) . That means that the induction hypothesis applies to the terms \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) . Let \\(m\\) be the number of \\([\\) in \\(s\\) and \\(m'\\) the number of \\([\\) in \\(s'\\) . By the induction hypothis applied to \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) , we have that \\(m< k/2\\) and \\(m' < k'/2\\) . Now, the number of \\([\\) in \\(t\\) is the number of \\([\\) in \\(s\\) , plus the number of \\([\\) in \\(s'\\) , plus \\(1\\) , i.e., it is \\(m + m' + 1\\) . Since \\(m < k/2\\) and \\(m' < k'/2\\) we have: \\[ m + m' + 1 < \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k'}{2} + 1 = \\frac{k+k'+2}{2} < \\frac{k+k'+3}{2} = n/2. \\] In each case, we have shown that the number of \\([\\) in \\(t\\) is less than \\(n/2\\) (on the basis of the inductive hypothesis). By strong induction, the claim follows. QED Additional Reading Chapter 5 of Open Logic Initiative Notes on Sets, Functions and Relations .

Show Answer The proof is by induction on \\(n\\) . Base Case: When \\(n=0\\) , we have \\(\\sum_{i=0}^0 2^i = 2^0=1 = 2^{0+1} - 1\\) . Let \\(k\\ge 0\\) . The induction hypothesis is \\(\\sum_{i=0}^k 2^i = 2^{k+1} - 1\\) . We must show that \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} 2^i = 2^{(k+1)+1} - 1\\) .

Induction Step: We must show that if \\(k\\ge 5\\) , then \\((k+1)^2 < 2^{k+1}\\) . Suppose that \\(k\\ge 5\\) . Then, \\(k^2\\ge 5k\\) . First, note that: \\[ \\begin{align} (k+1)^2 & = & k^2 + 2k + 1 \\\\ & < & k^2 + 2k + 5\\\\ & \\le & k^2 + 2k + k\\\\ & = & k^2 + 3k\\\\ & < & k^2 + 5k\\\\ & \\le & k^2 + k^2\\\\ & = & 2k^2 \\end{align} \\] Then, we have that: \\[ \\begin{align} (k+1)^2 & < & 2k^2 \\\\ & < & 2*2^k\\\\ & = & 2^{k+1} \\end{align} \\] The second inequality follows from the induction hypothesis. Therefore, by induction for all integers \\(n\\ge 5\\) , \\(n^2<2^n\\) . QED What is wrong with the following proof by induction that for all \\(n\\ge 0\\) , \\(n+3=n+7\\) ? Proof .

If \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) are nice terms, then so is \\([s \\circ s']\\) . Nothing else is a nice term. Examples of nice terms. The following are examples of nice terms include: \\(\\mathrm{a}\\) , \\([\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\) , \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{b}]\\circ [\\mathrm{c}\\circ\\mathrm{d}]]\\) , \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\circ[\\mathrm{b}\\circ[\\mathrm{c}\\circ[\\mathrm{d}\\circ\\mathrm{a}]]]]\\) . The length of a nice term is the number characters in the term. Note that we have the following The length of \\(\\mathrm{a}\\) is 1 and there are 0 occurrences of \\([\\) , The length of \\([\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\) is 5 and there is 1 occurrence of \\([\\) , The length of \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{b}]\\circ [\\mathrm{c}\\circ\\mathrm{d}]]\\) is 13 and there is 3 occurrences of \\([\\) , The length of \\([[\\mathrm{a}\\circ \\mathrm{a}]\\circ[\\mathrm{b}\\circ[\\mathrm{c}\\circ[\\mathrm{d}\\circ\\mathrm{a}]]]]\\) is 21 and there are 5 occurrences of \\([\\) . Notice that in each case, the number of occurrences of \\([\\) in a nice term is strictly less than \\(n/2\\) where \\(n\\) the length of the term. This is not necessarily true if an expression is not a nice term: The length of \\([[[[a\\circ b\\) is 6, but there are \\(4>6/2\\) occurrences of \\([\\) . Claim 3 . For any \\(n\\) , the number of \\([\\) in a nice term of length \\(n\\) is \\(< n/2\\) . Proof . We prove the statement by strong induction on the length of a nice term. A term of length 1 has 0 occurrences of the symbol ' \\([\\) ', so the statement holds for \\(n=1\\) . We must show the following conditional claim is true: If for every \\(k < n\\) , any nice term of length \\(k\\) has \\(k/2\\) \\([\\) 's, then any nice term of length \\(n\\) has \\(n/2\\) \\([\\) 's. To show this conditional, assume that for any \\(k< n\\) , nice terms of length \\(k\\) contain less than \\(k/2\\) occurrences of \\([\\) . This assumption is called the inductive hypothesis. We want to show the same is true for nice terms of length \\(n\\) . So suppose \\(t\\) is a nice term of length \\(n\\) . Because nice terms are inductively defined, we have two cases: (1) \\(t\\) is a letter by itself, or \\(t\\) is \\([s \\circ s']\\) for some nice terms \\(s\\) and~ \\(s'\\) . \\(t\\) is a letter. Then \\(n = 1\\) , and the number of \\([\\) in \\(t\\) is \\(0\\) . Since \\(0 < 1/2\\) , the claim holds. \\(t\\) is \\([s \\circ s']\\) for some nice terms \\(s\\) and~ \\(s'\\) . Let \\(k\\) be the length of \\(s\\) and \\(k'\\) be the length of \\(s'\\) . Then the length \\(n\\) of \\(t\\) is \\(k+k'+3\\) (the lengths of \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) plus three symbols \\([\\) , \\(\\circ\\) , \\(]\\) ). Since \\(k+k'+3\\) is always greater than \\(k\\) , \\(k < n\\) . Similarly, \\(k' < n\\) . That means that the induction hypothesis applies to the terms \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) . Let \\(m\\) be the number of \\([\\) in \\(s\\) and \\(m'\\) the number of \\([\\) in \\(s'\\) . By the induction hypothis applied to \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) , we have that \\(m< k/2\\) and \\(m' < k'/2\\) . Now, the number of \\([\\) in \\(t\\) is the number of \\([\\) in \\(s\\) , plus the number of \\([\\) in \\(s'\\) , plus \\(1\\) , i.e., it is \\(m + m' + 1\\) . Since \\(m < k/2\\) and \\(m' < k'/2\\) we have: \\[ m + m' + 1 < \\frac{k}{2} + \\frac{k'}{2} + 1 = \\frac{k+k'+2}{2} < \\frac{k+k'+3}{2} = n/2. \\] In each case, we have shown that the number of \\([\\) in \\(t\\) is less than \\(n/2\\) (on the basis of the inductive hypothesis).

We denote the application of a substitution as follows: \\[ \\varphi[\\psi_1/q_1, \\psi_2/q_2,\\ldots, \\psi_k/q_k] \\] The application of a substitution is defined by the following compositional definition: Applying a Subsitution Suppose that \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula of \\(LP(\\sigma)\\) , \\(q_1,\\ldots,q_k\\) are atomic propositions and \\(\\psi_1,\\ldots\\psi_k\\) are formulas of \\(LP(\\sigma)\\) . if \\(\\varphi\\) is an atomic proposition, then \\[ \\varphi[\\psi_1/q_1,\\ldots,\\psi_k/q_k]=\\begin{cases} \\psi_j & \\mbox{if }\\varphi\\mbox{ is }q_i (1\\le i\\le k)\\\\ \\varphi & \\mbox{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] if \\(\\varphi=(\\neg\\chi)\\) where \\(\\chi\\) is a formula, then \\[ \\varphi[\\psi_1/q_1,\\ldots,\\psi_k/q_k] = (\\neg \\chi[\\psi_1/q_1,\\ldots,\\psi_k/q_k]) \\] if \\(\\varphi=(\\chi_1\\Box \\chi_2)\\) where \\(\\chi_1\\) and \\(\\chi_2\\) are formulas and \\(\\Box\\in\\{\\wedge, \\vee, \\rightarrow,\\leftrightarrow\\}\\) , then \\[ \\varphi[\\psi_1/q_1,\\ldots,\\psi_k/q_k] = (\\chi_1[\\psi_1/q_1,\\ldots,\\psi_k/q_k]\\Box \\chi_2[\\psi_1/q_1,\\ldots,\\psi_k/q_k]) \\] For example, we use the above definition to show that \\[ (\\neg(p_1\\vee p_2))[(\\neg p_3)/p_1, p_4/p_2] = (\\neg((\\neg p_3)\\vee p_4)) \\] as follows: \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} (\\neg(p_1\\vee p_2))[(\\neg p_3)/p_1, p_4/p_2] & = & (\\neg(p_1\\vee p_2)[(\\neg p_3)/p_1, p_4/p_2])\\\\ & = & (\\neg(p_1[(\\neg p_3)/p_1, p_4/p_2]\\vee p_2[(\\neg p_3)/p_1, p_4/p_2]))\\\\ & = & (\\neg((\\neg p_3)\\vee p_4))\\\\ \\end{eqnarray} \\] Examples of substitutions \\((\\neg( p_1\\vee p_2))[p_2/p_1,p_3/p_2] = (\\neg( p_2\\vee p_3))\\) \\(((\\neg p_1)\\wedge (\\neg p_2))[p_2/p_1, p_3/p_2] = ((\\neg p_2)\\wedge (\\neg p_3))\\) \\((\\neg( p_1\\vee p_2))[p_3/p_1,(p_1\\wedge p_2)/p_2] = (\\neg( p_3\\vee (p_1\\wedge p_2)))\\) \\(((\\neg p_1)\\wedge (\\neg p_2))[p_3/p_1,(p_1\\wedge p_2)/p_2] = ((\\neg p_3)\\wedge (\\neg (p_1\\wedge p_2)))\\) \\((\\neg( p_1\\vee p_2))[(p_3\\vee p_4)/p_1,(p_1\\wedge p_2)/p_2] = (\\neg((p_3\\vee p_4)\\vee (p_1\\wedge p_2)))\\) \\(((\\neg p_1)\\wedge (\\neg p_2))[(p_3\\vee p_4)/p_1,(p_1\\wedge p_2)/p_2] = ((\\neg (p_3\\vee p_4))\\wedge (\\neg (p_1\\wedge p_2)))\\) The first observation is that \\(\\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\) is an equivalenc relation: Lemma: Logical equivalence is an equivalence relation Reflexivity: For all formulas \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(LP(\\sigma)\\) , \\(\\varphi\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ \\varphi\\) . Symmetry: For all formulas \\(\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2\\) of \\(LP(\\sigma)\\) , if \\(\\varphi_1\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ \\varphi_2\\) , then \\(\\varphi_2\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ \\varphi_1\\) . Transitivity: For all formulas \\(\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2, \\varphi_3\\) of \\(LP(\\sigma)\\) , if \\(\\varphi_1\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ \\varphi_2\\) and \\(\\varphi_2\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ \\varphi_3\\) , then \\(\\varphi_1\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ \\varphi_3\\) . The following two fundamental theorems show how to use subtitutions to derive logical equivalences. Substituion Theorem Let \\(S\\) be a substitution and \\(\\varphi_1\\) and \\(\\varphi_2\\) formulas of \\(LP(\\sigma)\\) . If \\(\\varphi_i\\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\varphi_2\\) , then \\(\\varphi_1[S]\\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\varphi_2[S]\\) . The substituion theorem can be used to verify the above three logical equivalences. For instance, to prove that \\((\\neg( p_2\\vee p_3))\\mathrel{\\mathsf{eq}} ((\\neg p_2)\\wedge (\\neg p_3))\\) , first note that we have shown that \\((\\neg( p_1\\vee p_2))\\mathrel{\\mathsf{eq}} ((\\neg p_1)\\wedge (\\neg p_2))\\) . Then, by the substitution theorem: \\[ (\\neg( p_1\\vee p_2))[p_2/p_1, p_3/p_2]\\mathrel{\\mathsf{eq}} ((\\neg p_1)\\wedge (\\neg p_2))[p_2/p_1, p_3/p_2] \\] That is, we have that: \\[ (\\neg( p_2\\vee p_3))\\mathrel{\\mathsf{eq}} ((\\neg p_2)\\wedge (\\neg p_3)) \\] The next theorem allows for the replacement of logically equivalent formulas. Replacement Theorem Let \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) be the substitutions \\[ [\\psi_1,q_1,\\ldots,\\psi_k,q_k]\\qquad\\qquad[\\psi'_1,q_1,\\ldots,\\psi'_k,q_k] \\] where for each \\(1\\le j\\le k\\) , \\(\\psi_j\\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\psi'_j\\) . Then for all formulas \\(\\varphi\\) , \\(\\varphi[S_1]\\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\varphi[S_2]\\) . Applying the Substitution and Replacement Theorems We can use the Substitution and Replacement theorem to show that \\[ ((\\neg p_3)\\rightarrow p_4)\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ (p_3\\vee p_4) \\] We have already seen that \\((p_1\\rightarrow p_2)\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ ((\\neg p_1)\\vee p_2)\\) . Then, by the substituion theorem: \\[ (p_1\\rightarrow p_2)[(\\neg p_3)/p_1, p_4/p_2]\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ ((\\neg p_1)\\vee p_2)[(\\neg p_3)/p_1, p_4/p_2] \\] That is, we have that: \\[ ((\\neg p_3)\\rightarrow p_4)\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ ((\\neg (\\neg p_3))\\vee p_4) \\] In the previous tutorial , we have that \\[ (\\neg(\\neg p_1))\\ \\mathrel{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ p_1 \\] By the subsitution theorem, \\[ (\\neg(\\neg p_3)) = (\\neg(\\neg p_1))[p_3/p_1]\\ \\mathrel{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ p_1[p_3/p_1]=p_3 \\] Then by the Replacement Theorem, we have that \\[ (p_3\\vee p_4)[(\\neg(\\neg p_3))/p_3]\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ (p_3\\vee p_4)[p_3/p_3] \\] So, we have shown: \\(((\\neg p_3)\\rightarrow p_4)\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ ((\\neg (\\neg p_3))\\vee p_4)\\) \\(((\\neg(\\neg p_3))\\vee p_4)\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ (p_3\\vee p_4)\\) By transitivity of logical equivalence, we have that: \\[ ((\\neg p_3)\\rightarrow p_4)\\ \\mathop{\\mathsf{eq}}\\ (p_3\\vee p_4). \\]","title":"Substitutions"},{"location":"week-3/02-substitutions/#aditional-reading","text":"Section 3.7 of Mathematical Logic by Chiswell and Hodges .","title":"Aditional Reading"},{"location":"week-3/02-substitutions/#exercises","text":"Use the substitution theorem to show that \\((\\neg( p_3\\vee (p_1\\wedge p_2)))\\mathrel{\\mathsf{eq}} ((\\neg p_3)\\wedge (\\neg (p_1\\wedge p_2)))\\) .
